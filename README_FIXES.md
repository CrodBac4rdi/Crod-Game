# Game Fixes Applied

## Issues Found and Fixed:

1. **Module Scope Issues**
   - All functions and constants were defined locally and not accessible between modules
   - Fixed by exposing all exports to the `window` object
   - Changed `const VARIABLE = ...` to `window.VARIABLE = ...`
   - Changed `function funcName() {...}` to `window.funcName = function() {...}`

2. **Files Modified:**
   - `/js/constants.js` - All constants now exposed globally
   - `/js/gameLogic.js` - All game logic functions exposed globally  
   - `/js/components.js` - All React components exposed globally
   - `/js/game.js` - Main game component exposed globally

3. **Debug Page Created:**
   - Created `debug.html` for testing module loading
   - Uses React development builds for better error messages
   - Shows which modules loaded successfully

## How to Test:

1. **Option 1: Open directly in browser (file:// protocol)**
   ```bash
   # Open in your default browser
   xdg-open /home/daniel/Schreibtisch/crod-game/index.html
   # Or
   firefox /home/daniel/Schreibtisch/crod-game/index.html
   ```

2. **Option 2: Use a local server**
   ```bash
   cd /home/daniel/Schreibtisch/crod-game
   # Try different ports if 8000 is in use
   python3 -m http.server 8001
   # Then open http://localhost:8001 in browser
   ```

3. **Option 3: Debug page**
   ```bash
   # Open the debug page to see module loading status
   xdg-open /home/daniel/Schreibtisch/crod-game/debug.html
   ```

## What the Game Should Do:

- Display a developer simulation tycoon game
- Show company stats, money, and level in header
- Have tabs for Overview, Projects, Team, Research, and Market
- Allow hiring developers and starting projects
- Game runs in real-time with pause/speed controls

## If Still Not Working:

Check browser console (F12) for:
- CORS errors (use a local server instead of file://)
- Missing functions (check if all window.* assignments worked)
- React errors (component rendering issues)
